# How To Read

This category contains all the built-in components that exist in Tau. There are a few things to note.

All pages contain the following
- What it does
- (Builder) Parameters
- Size Behaviour

### What it does
In this section, it will explain what the component does, simple enough.

### (Builder) Parameters
In this section, it will explain the parameters of this component.
If it is Builder Parameters, it means this component has a builder.
You should always use the builder of a component if there is one.

Here, it will also say if a parameter is optional or not, if it is, it will state its default value

### Size Behaviour
This can be either minimum or maximum.
Minimum means that the component will only take up as much space as it needs.
Maximum means that the component will take up as much space as it can.
